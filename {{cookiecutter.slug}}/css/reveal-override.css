/* This file is linked from index.html, and should include any CSS
   overrides that you want to apply to your selected reveal.js
   "{{cookiecutter.theme}}" theme.

   If you want to just apply a few simple overrides, then putting them
   directly into this file will probably suffice. For more involved
   changes, you'll probably want to put those into a Sass template
   that you then render into this file.
