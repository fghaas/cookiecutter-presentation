Auto-generated QR codes

<!-- Note -->
Presentations made with this template make it easy to include
generated QR codes. The define a CSS class named `qrcode`, and any
`<a>` element with that class turns into a QR code.

The idea behind this is that you can add a QR code containing the link
to your hosted slides at the beginning of your talk, so that attendees
who may be unable to see the projected slides (because of a visual
impairment, or simply because they’re in an unfortunately-located
seat) can follow along on a hand-held device like a phone or tablet.

The template makes it easy for you to combine this with reveal.js
multiplexing, which allows you to have the slides on your attendees’
devices advance in step with your own.

Combined with showing speaker notes like you see here, this can also
be of great benefit to listeners who don’t share your first language.

Speaking of CSS classes, the template also defines a convenience class
named `hidden`, which will hide an element from display in
presentation mode (but not in the `Esc` overview, nor in the `m`
menu). This enables you to make a slide title-less when it doesn’t
need one for display – like this slide —, but still have a descriptive
title in the menu and overview.
