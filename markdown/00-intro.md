<!-- Note --> 
This is a demo presentation that describes the design and features of
`cookiecutter-presentation`, a
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
template that creates an opinionated
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation.

`cookiecutter-presentation` attempts to make it easy to create a
presentation that is minimalistic, straightforward, and accessible.

You can cycle through this demo by 

* using the controls shown on each slide,
* using the `PgUp` and `PgDown` keys,
* hitting the spacebar or left mouse/touchpad button,
* swiping on a touchscreen device,
* enabling Overview mode by hitting the `Esc` key (or pinch-zooming
  out on a touchscreen device), and then selecting the slide of your liking,
* clicking the menu icon (&equiv;) or pressing the `m` key for a slide menu.
