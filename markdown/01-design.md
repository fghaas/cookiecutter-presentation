# Design

Minimalistic

High-contrast

<!-- Note -->
Presentations created with this Cookiecutter are minimalistic in
design. They allow only two reveal.js themes, both coming with maximum
contrast.

`white` uses black, sans-serif text on a white background. This is the
default, and the general recommendation. In tends to produce
well-readable slides even in unfortunate lighting conditions, such as
a relatively bright room with a weak projector. This is the mode that
this demo uses.

`black` uses white, sans-serif text on a black background. This is a
high-contrast theme suitable for conditions where the presentation
room is generally dark, and you have good projection equipment
available. Under such circumstances, the white theme might be very
strenuous on attendeesâ€™ eyes.
